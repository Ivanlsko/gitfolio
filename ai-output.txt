   - **End-to-End Testing:** Configured Cypress to validate the functionality and UI through e2e testing. Initial tests ensure the homepage loads correctly and essential content is accessible.
   - **Custom Commands:** Developed reusable Cypress commands to improve test efficiency and readability, showcasing strong automated testing practices.

3. **Backend Development:**
   - **Node.js and Express:** Created an API using Node.js and Express to handle email inquiries, demonstrating server-side development proficiency.
   - **Email Functionality:** Set up email functionality using Nodemailer and SMTP, with environment variables for managing credentials securely. This feature enables visitors to send messages directly to the quintet's booking email.
   - **CORS and Middleware:** Implemented CORS and body-parser middleware to handle cross-origin requests and parse incoming request bodies, ensuring a secure API.

4. **Innovative Techniques:**
   - **Dynamic Data Binding:** Leveraged Vueâ€™s data binding for form inputs and displays, providing real-time user feedback and enhancing interactivity.
   - **Custom Hooks and Functions:** Built reusable functions for common actions like form submission and section navigation, minimizing redundancy and following best coding practices.
   - **Builder's Insights:** Integrated component testing frameworks seamlessly, reflecting an understanding of modern testing practices and continuous integration.
